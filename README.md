:fork_and_knife: Practice Project
=================================

A project created to practice all those things I need to learn to do in SPARKEATS, the 2017 Sparkbox Apprenticeship project created by myself and [Betty Baker].

I am learning how to:
---------------------
* write package.json scripts
* configure Sass to CSS
* set up sourcemaps and a postcss script that compiles CSS vendor prefixes
* set up a development server using Browsersync
* create watch scripts that watch Sass for changes, then automatically update CSS
* set up Heroku
* resolve merge conflicts in github
